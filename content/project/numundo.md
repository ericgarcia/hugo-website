I met up with the [NuMundo](https://numundo.org/about) crew in the Fall of 2014 as they were applying to [Startup Chile](http://startupchile.org/about). I helped with the application process and when we were accepted I took the year off from work to move to Chile and architect and build the backend of their web application. The platform continues to progress and I continue to contribute to development as a full stack engineer.
